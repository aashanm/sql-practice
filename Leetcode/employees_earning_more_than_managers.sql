The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

| Employee |

| Joe      |

SELECT e.Name AS Employee 
FROM Employee AS e,
     Employee AS m
# selects from tables twice
WHERE e.Salary > m.Salary 
# where employee salary greater than manager salary
AND e.ManagerId = m.Id 
# employee table's maanger ID is equal to manager table's ID
